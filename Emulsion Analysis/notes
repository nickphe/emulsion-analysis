To Do
    implement radial averaging 
        radially averaged curve fit

        problem with the radial average curve fit -> you lose 2 dof in picking the center, which can cause probles in the fit. 

        could sort radial data then find point of discontinuity in second or first derivative..?
    
    Need to make loop and manage saving outputs


Best course of action seems to use signal anlysis for inner radii guess and voronoi analysis for outer radius guess.
Also, the voronoi provided segmentation is just lovely. 
Also, it seems that filtering the UNCERTAINTY of the DILUTE PHASE RADIUS yields accurate volume fraction measurements. 


It looks like the "analysis log" csv file isn't being saved to the capillary folder after capillary one.

Try vf with den phase radii from ilastik area, voronoi dilute phase radii

perhaps need to fit just the dense phase?

I think there's a memory leak somewhere causing the kernel to kill itself!?
