# emulsion-analysis

Image analysis scripts for analysis of microscopy images of droplet-microfluidics emulsions. 
A repository to store what I've written while analyzing volume fractions of DNA nanostar emulsions. 

Currently the program works to segment droplets from images of emulsions, and fit the "intensity profile" of a double-sphere to each droplet.
